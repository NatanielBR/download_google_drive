## Getting direct URL from Google Drive using Python 3 using video id.

### Guide for usage:
- Import the class Drive.
- Use the method `get_download_link_direct` with video id as parameter.


### Stream Video

- In theory the method `video_stream` with video id as parameter works, but in my tests no.
